                    <p class="about__text">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California.
                        The
                        band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green,
                        bassist Kent
                        Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an
                        unsigned act,
                        drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts (The Elephant In
                        The
                        Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further,
                        pushing
                        them to sign with Magenta Records. </p>
                    <p class="about__text">From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
                        ranking in
                        the
                        top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and
                        organic
                        attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
                        century.
                        Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and
                        authentic
                        performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently
                        recording
                        their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.</p>
